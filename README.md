Hi!
My name is Kseniya and I am a beginner data analyst. I have bachelor's degree in Biomedicine and I'm continuing my studies in Biotechnologies. Until recently, I worked in the molecular biology department as a laboratory manager. My bioinformatics skripts you can find in other repositorium "Skripts". 
Here you can find my portfolio with some tasks, that I did during my online studies for product data anaytics.
1. Unit economics calculator (in russian): "Данные_калькулятор" and "онлайн-кинотеатр"
2. You can also find my SQL code here https://platform.stratascratch.com/user/xeni_sunflower
