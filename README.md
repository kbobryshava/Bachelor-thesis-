Hi!
My name is Kseniya and I am a data analyst and molecular biologist. I have bachelor's degree in Biomedicine and I'm continuing my studies in Biotechnologies. Tt my last job I worked as a laboratory manager in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of South Bohemia. 

I speak three languages russian, czech and english. As molecular biologist I work a lot with big data. I mostly use Bash for my skripts and Geneious prime for working with NGS sequencing data.My bioinformatics skripts you can find in other repositorium "Skripts". 

Here you can find my portfolio with some tasks, that I did during my online studies for product data anaytics.
